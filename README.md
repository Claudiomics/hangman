## What is Hangman?

Hangman is a classic guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player has to guess the letters and eventually the word. Each wrong guess of a letter or word reduces the players' lives by one until they run out and their stick figure is 'hanged'.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the ***computer*** thinks of a word and the user tries to guess the letters with a certain number of attempts.

> This program uses the Python3 programming language and imported the library '**random**' in order to run the game.
