# Project Hangman

## What is hangman?
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. 

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## File Structure within this project

### Milestone_2.py contains variables
I have created variables within the file milestone_2.py which can be used within the hangman game. These variables inclue a list of fruits, a random word generator called 'word' which supplied a random word from that list, and a user input which only allows users to input one character from the alphabet.

### Milestone_3.py defines functions
This python file includes two functions for this project. One is to convert the users guess to lower case before checking if the guess is in the randomly generated word. The second asks the user for input and checks it is a valid single alphabetical guess.
